# changeMAC
This script will update the MAC address of your machine with a randomly generated MAC address.

The script is only tested on Ubuntu and MAC OSX, pretty sure this should work for all Linux systems.
Feel free to fork and add more support for other OS.

## Usage:
Linux: ./changeMAC_Linux.sh
Mac: ./changeMAC_OSX.sh
