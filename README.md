# changeMAC
This script will update the MAC address of your machine with a randomly generated MAC address.

The script is only tested on Ubuntu and MAC OSX, pretty sure this should work for all Linux systems.
Feel free to fork and add more support for other OS.

Since we're using MAC Address randomizer, some mac addresses maybe invalid. 
So, please try running the script for 4-5 times if it doesn't work the first time.

## Usage:
- Linux: ./changeMAC_Linux.sh
- Mac: ./changeMAC_OSX.sh
